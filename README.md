# Wander 2.0

Version 2 of my first full stack project for dog lovers 🐕👋🐶

This time using a more modern stack i.e. react/typescript for the frontend.

## Description

Wander is a service that will let you look at dogs, and show them your appreciation & love with "like" and "pat" buttons. Or even better, create a profile for your beloved doggo on Wander for others to send your doggo some love! ❤️

The aim of this service is to enable dog lovers to stare and appreciate dogs, and for dog owners to show off their beloved dog(s) and validate how cool their dog is.

## Stack

- React + Typescript
- Express + Typescript

## Status

WIP. Initial stages of setup.

## Special thanks

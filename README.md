# Wander 2.0

Version 2 of my first full stack project for dog lovers 🐕👋🐶

This time using a more modern stack i.e. react/typescript for the frontend.

## Description

Wander is simply a social media for dogs :dog:

Are you looking for some cute dog pics?
Or do you want to share your dog pics for internet points & :heart:?

Well, you've found the perfect place :dog2:

## Status

WIP. Initial stages of setup.

## Stack (WIP)

- React + Typescript
- SASS
- Express + Typescript
- GCP
- Docker

## How to run it locally

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/asawo/wander-v2.git && cd wander-v2
```

#### Setting up the frontend

2. Run these commands from the client directory

```
cd client
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build-dev
```

You can check if the frontend is working by running `npm start`, which will start a webpack dev server.

#### Setting up the backend

3. Run these commands from the server directory

```
cd server
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```
